# Racquet Rumble

## Introduction

Racquet Rumble, also known by its working title Ciriacochet, presents a thrilling narrative set in a world where tennis has been corrupted by greed and unethical behavior. As the last honorable player, Ryan must confront his corrupted peers in a battle for the integrity of the sport. Can he withstand the onslaught and restore tennis to its former glory?

## Mechanics

In Racquet Rumble, players control Ryan as he faces off against four computer-controlled opponents simultaneously. Each opponent is positioned in a different direction, and players must choose Ryan's facing direction to return the ball. With each successful return, Ryan earns a score point. However, as the game progresses, opponents become more aggressive, testing the player's reflexes and strategic skills.

## Characters

- **Ryan**: The protagonist and the only playable character. Players control Ryan's movements using the arrow keys on the keyboard. His mission is to outlast the corrupted opponents and save the sport of tennis.
- **WTA and ATP (the enemies)**: The corrupt tennis players representing the Wicked Tennis Association and the Abhorrent Tennis Professionals. They act as Ryan's adversaries, each positioned as a wall that the ball can collide with. These NPCs include twisted versions of famous tennis players like Roger Federevil and Rafael Nadiabolical.

## Elements

- **Ball**: The ball bounces between Ryan and the enemies, moving in a straight path until it collides with an object. As the game progresses, the balls increase in velocity, challenging the player's ability to react and strategize.
- **Score**: Players earn points each time Ryan successfully returns the ball to an opponent. The score is displayed on the screen, motivating players to aim for higher scores.
- **Health**: Ryan's health decreases each time he fails to return the ball, ultimately leading to the end of the game if depleted.

## Implementation

- **Ryan Class**: Implement a class for Ryan, containing functions to update his position and handle keyboard inputs for movement.
- **Enemy Class**: Implement a class for enemies, representing the corrupted tennis players. This class manages their positions and behaviors within the game.
- **Ball Class**: Implement a class for the ball, controlling its movement, collision detection, and speed adjustments.
- **Game Logic**: Develop game logic to track scores, update health, and manage game states, including the title screen, gameplay, and end screen.
